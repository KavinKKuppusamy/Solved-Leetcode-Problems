176. Second Highest Salary

Idea:
---------
Use OFFSET which defines where to start the limiting.
Use Another Select to manage the NULL Cases


Solution Try: 
---------------

This was my first idea.

SELECT DISTINCT Salary as SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

However, this solution will be judged as 'Wrong Answer' if there is no such second highest salary since there might be only one record in this table. To overcome this issue, we can take this as a temp table.


Solution 1:
-----------

SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;


Solution 2: Use IFNULL:
---------------------

SELECT IFNULL(
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary   
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC 
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) ,NULL) as SecondHighestSalary;


Solution3 : Use Subquery, max(salary) < (select max(salary))
--------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)


Solution4 : Using Window Function and Temp Table
--------------------------------------------------

WITH Rank_salary_table AS (
    SELECT Salary,  DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) as Salary_Rank
    FROM Employee)
    
SELECT IFNULL(max(Salary),NULL) SecondHighestSalary
FROM Rank_salary_table
WHERE Salary_Rank = 2;
