181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

Idea:
------
Just to do Inner Join and compare the salary with employee and manager
When you do SELF JOIN, make sure you give the correct condition 
For eg, First I gave emp.Id = mgr.ManagerId instead of the correct one, which was wrong

Solution:
---------

SELECT emp.Name as Employee
FROM Employee emp
INNER JOIN Employee mgr ON emp.ManagerId = mgr.Id
WHERE emp.salary > mgr.salary;


Solution-2:
-------------

SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary;
