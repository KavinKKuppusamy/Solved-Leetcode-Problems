DENSE_RANK - If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.


RANK - There will be gaps over the ties

Solution:
---------

SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as 'Rank'
FROM Scores;

SOlution2:
-----------

SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(distinct Score) FROM Scores WHERE Score >= s.Score) Rank
FROM Scores s
ORDER BY Score desc
or

SELECT
  Score,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM (SELECT distinct Score s FROM Scores) tmp WHERE s >= Score) Rank
FROM Scores
ORDER BY Score desc



Solution3:
------------

select m2.Score,
count(distinct m1.Score)+1 as Rank
from Scores m1, Scores m2
where m1.Score > m2.Score
order by Rank;
