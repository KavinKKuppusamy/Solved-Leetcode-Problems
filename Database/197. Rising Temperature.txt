197. Rising Temperature


Idea 1
----------
Using Window Function (Lag), get the difference in temperature and date.

Solution1: 
----------
WITH Weather_Diff AS(

    SELECT id, 
    Temperature  - LAG(Temperature) OVER(ORDER BY recordDate) temp_diff ,
    DATEDIFF(recordDate , LAG(recordDate) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate)) date_diff   
    FROM Weather)


SELECT id
FROM Weather_Diff
WHERE temp_diff > 0 and date_diff = 1;



or
---

SELECT id FROM
	(SELECT *, 
	lag(temperature) over(ORDER BY recorddate) AS previousTemp,
	lag(recorddate) over (ORDER BY recorddate) AS previousDay
	FROM weather) AS compare_temp
WHERE temperature>previousTemp
AND datediff(recorddate, previousDay)=1;



---------------------------------------------------------------
Idea 2
------

Using Self Join and make the date_diff in on condition


SELECT
    weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.recordDate, w.recordDate) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
or 


select w1.Id
from Weather w1, Weather w2
where (w1.RecordDate = w2.RecordDate + 1) and (w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature);

or

FROM Weather a,Weather b
WHERE a.Temperature > b.Temperature
AND DATEDIFF(a.Recorddate,b.Recorddate) = 1


or 


SELECT Weather.Id 
FROM   Weather 
       JOIN Weather AS w 
         ON w.RecordDate = SUBDATE(Weather.RecordDate, 1) 
WHERE  Weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
