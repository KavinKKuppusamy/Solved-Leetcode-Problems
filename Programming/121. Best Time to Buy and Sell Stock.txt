            if prices[i] < min_buy:

Concise Solution:
----------------------


Solution:
We always need to know what is the maxProfit we can make if we sell the stock on i-th day. So, keep track of maxProfit.
There might be a scenario where if stock bought on i-th day is minimum and we sell it on (i + k)th day. So, keep track of minPurchase as well.

def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
	if not prices:
		return 0

	maxProfit = 0
	minPurchase = prices[0]
	for i in range(1, len(prices)):		
		maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPurchase)
		minPurchase = min(minPurchase, prices[i])
	return maxProfit
