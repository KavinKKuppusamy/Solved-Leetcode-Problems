278. First Bad Version


Naive Approach
--------------
Linear Scan (O(n))

Better Approach:
----------------
Binary Search

Task is to find the firt occurrence of the Bad outcome.


My Solution:
-----------
class Solution(object):
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        l = 1
        r = n
        while ( l < r):
            m = l + (r-l)//2
            if(isBadVersion(m)):
                r = m
            else:
                l = m +1
        return l
