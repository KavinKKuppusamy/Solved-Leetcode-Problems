27. Remove Element

Basic Idea:
---------
We want to return the array length (arr_len) after the removal of val whereas the first arr_len elements of the nums should the elements which are not val.

Eg: nums = [1,2,4,4,2,5] val = 2
return arr_len = 4 --->  [1,4,4,5] or [1,4,4,5,2,2] (Doesn't matter if you keep or not the val in  returned nums)

Idea is to use two pointer method 

curr_size = curr_size will return length of array after removal
i = travers throught array

when nums[i] is not equal to val, you copy nums[i] to nums[curr_size] and increment curr_size.

Solution:
---------

class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        curr_size = 0  ## curr_size will return length of array after removal
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[curr_size] = nums[i]
                curr_size += 1
        return curr_size
